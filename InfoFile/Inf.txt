A household robot, for example, should be able to find its way around new obstacles like baby gates or rearranged furniture.
Her team created an AI that without human input can identify when it needs further training. 
Each time the AI runs into a new obstacle, it takes stock of how its surroundings are different from what it expected. 
Then it devises various workarounds and calculates the outcome of each. Afterward, it chooses the best solution.
